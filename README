dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.

PS
----
This is my personal fork of dmenu, which includes lot of patches which serve to
make it easier to use or more versatile. These patches have also been reworked
into `ifdef` clauses in order to make them more modular and where possible
co-compatible.

The list of patches enabled by default include:
